# VaaniVerse: The Inclusive Multimodal AI Companion

VaaniVerse is an AI-powered, voice-first, multimodal platform designed to bridge language, literacy, and accessibility barriers. It enables access to public services, mentorship, and travel guidance through simple voice calls, SMS, or WhatsApp messagesâ€”without requiring apps, typing, or high-end devices.
